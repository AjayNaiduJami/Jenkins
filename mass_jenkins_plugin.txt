# Scripted Jenkins Plugins install

Jenkins has a very rich catalog of plugins and it's quite easy to install and update them via UI.
BTW, when you want to add tons of plugin via UI, it's a fairly long and boring procedure.

Hopefully, mass installation (or update) could be easy using a simple bash script (curl/python required) :

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hgomez/devops-incubator/master/forge-tricks/batch-install-jenkins-plugins.sh

Create a file containing plugins to be installed (or updated), ie iplugins :

    analysis-core
    audit-trail
    build-flow-plugin
    buildgraph-view
    build-metrics
    build-timeout
    changelog-history
    claim
    config-file-provider
    configurationslicing
    console-column-plugin
    dashboard-view
    greenballs
    htmlpublisher
    mercurial
    sonar
    ssh-agent
    thucydides
    timestamper
    viewVC
    WebSVN2

If you want some plugins to be excluded, for example those found in dependency list, create a second file with excluded list (ie, xplugins):

    ant
    antisamy-markup-formatter
    credentials
    cvs
    external-monitor-job
    javadoc
    ldap
    mailer
    matrix-auth
    maven-plugin
    pam-auth
    ssh-credentials
    ssh-slaves
    subversion
    translation
    windows-slaves

Then get script :

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hgomez/devops-incubator/master/forge-tricks/batch-install-jenkins-plugins.sh -o batch-install-jenkins-plugins.sh

* --plugins (or -p) is for file containing plugins to be installed 
* --excludedplugins (or -e) is for file containing plugins to be excluded
* --plugindir (or -p) is for directory path to copy plugins (.jpi) 
 
   batch-install-jenkins-plugins.sh --plugins iplugins --excludedplugins xplugins --plugindir /var/lib/myjenkins/plugins

batch-install-jenkins-plugins.sh will download json file containing up to date plugins and will download plugins to be installed and  non optional dependent plugins 

Of course, better run this script when Jenkins is down to avoid runtime issue.

Script powo !
